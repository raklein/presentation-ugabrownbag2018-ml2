# presentation-ugabrownbag2018-ml2
Presentation I gave for the Brownbag on ML2 at Universite Grenoble Alpes (https://datadoct2018.sciencesconf.org/). Dec 10, 2018.

Created with the [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) R package. cropped_script.pdf is a simple way to view the presentation, or download it and run the script yourself.
